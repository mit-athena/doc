This file is intended to keep track of user-visible changes to the
release, for the construction of the Athena release notes.

Changes from release 8.0 to release 8.1:

	* Athena version numbers are now dotted triplets, e.g. 8.1.0
	  or 8.1.12.  Paths which include all or part of the Athena
	  version number now take the form "pathname-version",
	  e.g. "srvd-8.1" or "dash.menus-8.1"

	* In release 8.0, running "xmkmf" with the default path would
	  generate a Makefile which looked for its include files and
	  libraries in /mit/x11, which could be one of several
	  lockers.  Now it is preferrable to use the vendor X
	  libraries, so this bit of glue is going away.  There will be
	  no /usr/athena/bin/xmkmf any more, nor any symlinks in
	  /usr/athena pointing to the x11 locker.

	  Users can still do something like "add -f x11r5" and then
	  "xmkmf", and things should work, if the x11r5 locker is
	  built for their platform.

	* Athena bitmaps have moved to /usr/athena/include/X11/bitmaps.
	  Previously, they were in /usr/athena/lib/X11/bitmaps before
	  because of the /mit/x11 glue.

	* The symlink /bin/csh -> /bin/athena/tcsh has gone away.  The
	  update from 8.0 to 8.1 will fix /bin/csh references in
	  /etc/passwd and /etc/passwd.local to refer to
	  /bin/athena/tcsh instead.

	* The command emacs18 has gone away, as advertised.  The
	  command emacs19 has become a script which advertises that
	  the emacs19 command will go away in summer 1998, and then
	  executes emacs.  People should run just "emacs" in their
	  dotfiles and scripts.

	* AFS includes and libraries are installed in
	  /usr/afsws/include and /usr/afsws/lib.

	* emacs has been upgraded to version 19.34.  There should be
	  no significant user-visible changes.

	* /usr/gcc/bin/gcc on Solaris is now version 2.7.2.1.

	* The basic Kerberos 5 headers and libraries are installed in
	  /usr/athena.

	* The MH mail-reading software has been upgraded to version
	  6.8.3 from version 6.8.0.

	* patch, which we provide on Solaris only, has been upgraded
	  to version 2.1.  On the SGI, we use the vendor-supplied
	  version, as before.

	* RCS, which we provide on Solaris only, has been upgraded
	  to version 5.7.  On the SGI, we use the vendor-supplied
	  version, as before.

	* sysinfo has been upgraded to version 3.2.2 and is now
	  available on the SGI as well as on Solaris.

	* /bin/athena/tcsh now has Hesiod support enabled, which means
	  that "~lockername" will work in a pathname in most cases.
	  (It won't work for users with local passwd information who
	  don't have their lockers attached.)

	* Some parts of tex have been upgraded.  We are now using
	  web2c version 6.1, dvips 558, xdvi 20, and essentially the
	  same collection of fonts and macro files as we had before.
	  For the most part, there should be no significant
	  user-visible changes.

	* top, which we provide on Solaris only, has been upgraded to
	  version 3.4.

	* wcl has been upgraded to version 2.7.  wcl header files and
	  libraries are now installed in /usr/athena.

	* x3270 has been upgraded to version 3.1.1.3.

	* For improved ease of debugging, many binaries are installed
	  with symbol tables, and compiled without optimization.
	  Therefore, the contents of /bin/athena and /usr/athena/bin
	  may be somewhat larger, and the binaries may consume more
	  CPU cycles, although it's unlikely that anyone will notice
	  the speed difference.

	* Updates to Athena releases now include a phase which runs
	  after a reboot, so machines will reboot twice during an
	  update.  For manual updates, the first reboot will be
	  done automatically, and the administrator will be given a
	  shell prompt before the second reboot.  For automatic
	  updates, both reboots will be done automatically.

	* The Hesiod library has been revamped.  Developers who use
	  the Hesiod library should look at the improved interfaces; a
	  full suite of man pages is available (see "man hesiod", "man
	  hesiod_getmailhost", "man hesiod_getpwnam", and  "man
	  hesiod_getservbyname").

	* An attach.conf file with additional security features
	  enabled has been installed.  The most noticeable change is
	  that the setuid and setgid bits on programs in NFS mounted
	  lockers will not be honored.

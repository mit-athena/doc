This file is intended to keep track of user-visible changes to the
release, for the construction of the Athena release notes.

Changes from release 8.0 to release 8.1:

	* In release 8.0, running "xmkmf" with the default path would
	  generate a Makefile which looked for its include files and
	  libraries in /mit/x11, which could be one of several
	  lockers.  Now it is preferrable to use the vendor X
	  libraries, so this bit of glue is going away.  There will be
	  no /usr/athena/bin/xmkmf any more, nor any symlinks in
	  /usr/athena pointing to the x11 locker.

	  Users can still do something like "add -f x11r5" and then
	  "xmkmf", and things should work, if the x11r5 locker is
	  built for their platform.

	* Athena bitmaps have moved to /usr/athena/include/X11/bitmaps.
	  Previously, they were in /usr/athena/lib/X11/bitmaps before
	  because of the /mit/x11 glue.

	* The symlink /bin/csh -> /bin/athena/tcsh has gone away.

	* emacs18 has gone away.

	* In release 8.0, we made symlinks in /usr/lib for the X
	  libraries under Solaris.  These are no longer present.  The
	  LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable should take care of
	  programs which do not have a runtime path, and the Athena
	  release is built with runtime paths for all the programs on
	  the packs.

	  LD_LIBRARY_PATH will include /usr/dt/lib as well as
	  /usr/openwin/lib for easy use of the Solaris Motif
	  libraries.

	* <need an item about named>

	* AFS includes and libraries are installed in
	  /usr/afsws/include and /usr/afsws/lib.

	* wcl includes and libraries are installed in /usr/athena.

	* The basic krb5 headers and libraries are installed in
	  /usr/athena.

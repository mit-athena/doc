For the most part, third-party software is easy to locate because it
is found in the third hierarchy.  Nevertheless, it's a good idea to
keep track of what we get from outside, especially for things outside
of third.

Third-party stuff not under third
---------------------------------

	* packs/config/named.root

		This file contains the named.root file available at
		rs.internic.edu:/domain/named.root.

	* packs/config/Dash.fallback

		A fallback copy of
		/afs/athena.mit.edu/system/dash/Dash.menus for when
		the master copy is inaccessible.  This should be
		updated at release time.

Distribution sites for software under third
-------------------------------------------

This is a partial list at the moment.

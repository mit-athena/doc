	Setting the process priority

Setting the process priority
----------------------------
XXX this doesn't work on all platforms; this section needs revisiting.

You should use the function nice() to change the process priority
relative to its current value.  Avoid using setpriority() and
getpriority().

To set the current process priority to 0, use "nice(-nice(0))", since
nice(0) will return the current process priority.  (Obviously, you can
only do this with root permissions.)
